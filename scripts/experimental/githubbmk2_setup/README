bmk2.cfg
-----

Setup the path to the built apps (Lonestar build directory) and where to output
logs for each benchmark here under pathToApps and logOutputDirectory.

-----
bmktest2.py
-----

This file defines all the benchmarks to be run. Each benchmark is defined as a
class that inherits from SharedMemApp.

The runtime looks for relativeAppPath, which points to the executable, and
benchmark, which is the name given to that benchmark when outputting things
and, more importantly, the name used to refer to said benchmark run by bmk2 in
other files.

If any arguments to that benchmark need to be specified, you define the
get_run_spec function to add args. See examples there in the current bmktest2.py
file to get a feel of how to do it.

The SharedMemApp parent class is where default parameters such as threads
are specified. startThread, endThread, and step are the variables to edit
for this purpose.

The benchmarks that will be run are specified in the BINARIES array. For
example, the below definition will run BarnesHut and BFS:

BINARIES = [BarnesHut(), BFS()]

-----
lonestar.inputdb
-----

Inputs to benchmarks are specified here.

To begin, change the "basepath" variable in the header to point to the root
directory where are inputs are stored.

The format for specifying an input is as follows:

[<input name>]
flags =
name = <name to refer to input as in bmk2>
file = <relative path to file from root input directory "basepath">
format = file format

There are a couple of file formats to be aware of:

bin/galois = binary galois format
mesh/nodes = mesh format
triangles = format for triangle counting
text = text format (for things like points-to-analysis)
nothing = no file is passed in (for things like self generated input)

-----
lonestar.inputprops
-----

Additional properties for certain inputs can be specified in the inputprops
file.

[<same input name used in header for input in inputdb>]
<additional property>=<what additional property is>

For example, I can specify the transpose graph as following:

[soc-livejournal]
ptranspose=/net/ohm/export/iss/inputs/unweighted/soc-LiveJournal1.ptgr

It can then be referred to in the bmktest2.py python script as the example
below shows:

s.set_arg("-graphTranspose=%s" % bmkinput.props.ptranspose)

-----
lonestar.bispec
-----

This file is where one specifies which input to run with a particular bmk2
benchmark. Use the name given in the benchmark variable in bmktest2 to
refer to a benchmark and the name given under the name variable in
lonestar.inputdb to refer to an input. For example, the below lines says to
run bfs with the twitter40 input.

bfs twitter40

-----
How to run:
-----

defaultrunscript.sh has a default command to start the bmk2 runtime and use the
config specified in the directory you run it from.
