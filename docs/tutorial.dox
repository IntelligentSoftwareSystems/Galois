@section goal_tutorial Goal of this Tutorial

This tutorial is targeted to people who want to start writing Galois programs on shared memory, which are legal C++ parallel programs. It assumes that readers are familiar with C++ and have some knowledge about parallel programming.

The following topics are outside the scope of this tutorial:
<ol>
<li> Performance programming in Galois, such as optimizing for non-uniform memory access (NUMA). However, there will be some discussion on this at the end of the tutorial.
<li> Extending Galois such as implementing new parallel data structures, schedulers or parallelism patterns.
<li> Distributed programming with D-Galois, which includes Gluon communication substrate, CuSP graph partitioner, etc.
</ol>


@section galois_program Galois Programs

@subsection execution_model Execution Model

A Galois program alternates its execution in between serial and parallel phases. The execution begins serially on the master thread, whose thread ID is 0. Other threads wait in a "sleep" state in galois::substrate::ThreadPool, which is created by galois::SharedMemSys. Upon encountering a parallel section, the Galois runtime wakes up the threads in cascade, and hands each thread a work function. Threads synchronize at a barrier at the end of the parallel section. In the current implementation, parallel sections are loops and work items are iterations of that loop. This is summarized in the following figure.

@image html galois_execution_model.png "Galois Execution Model"

Galois is different from other models in the following two ways:
<ol>
<li> Parallel work may or may not be independent; the implementation guarantees transactional execution of each work item (iteration).
<li> Parallel sections may create and execute new work items. For example, computing single-source shortest path will create new work items if nodes' distances are lowered.
</ol>

@subsection structure_overview Structure Overview

A Galois user program consists of operators, schedules and data structure API calls. The Galois library implements schedulers and data structures, which are built upon thread primitives and memory allocators. This is summarized by the following figure.

Throughout this tutorial, we will use the following application as our running example: `read in an undirected graph with edge weights and then set the label of each node to the sum of the weights on the edges connected to the node.` There are two ways to implement this application:

- If it is implemented as a *pull*-style algorithm, each node iterates over its edges and computes its own label; there are no conflicts among activities at different nodes.
- If it is implemented as a *push*-style algorithm, each node iterates over its edges and for each edge, the node updates the weight of the destination node; therefore, activities may conflict with each other.

Both variants iterate over all nodes, so they are *topology-driven* algorithms.

Below we will cover parallel data structures, parallel loop iterators, and worklists and schedules.


@section galois_lc_graphs Parallel Data Structures

For graph computation, Galois provides unified, standard APIs to access graph elements and a set of graph implementations optimized for NUMA-awareness, conflict detection, and interoperability with the Galois runtime system. For details, see @ref concurrent_data_structures.

@subsection galois_ds_graphs Graphs

All graphs are in the namespace galois::graphs. There are two basic types of graphs:
<ol>
<li> galois::graphs::MorphGraph: It allows insertion and removal of nodes and edges. It is used in morph algorithms like Delaunay mesh refinement. A variation called galois::graphs::LC_Morph_Graph can be used if (1) no nodes will be deleted, and (2) a node's maximum degree is known when it is created.
<li> galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph: It disallows creation and removal of nodes and edges. Internally, it is implemented in Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format as shown in the following figure. Undirected edges are represented as two directed edges. Galois also provides variants of this graph with different storage representations, e.g., galois::graphs::LC_InlineEdge_Graph, galois::graphs::LC_Linear_Graph, galois::graphs::LC_InOut_Graph.
</ol>

@htmlonly
<style>div.image img[src="csr_format_example.png"]{width:70%}</style>
@endhtmlonly
@image html csr_format_example.png "Graph in CSR Format. Left: graphic representation, where numbers in circles (nodes) are node IDs and numbers on arrows (directed edges) are edge weights. Right: CSR representation, which comprises of 4 arrays - Node data, indexed by node IDs, stores data labels of each node; Edge index, indexed by (source) node IDs, stores indices of the first corresponding edges; Edge destination, indexed by edge IDs (chunked in the sequence of node IDs), stores the corresponding (destination) node IDs; Edge data, indexed by edge IDs, stores edge labels (weights in this example) of each edge."

We will focus on galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph in this section; @ref galois_morph_graph_api are discussed later. When defining a galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph, you must provide as template parameters `NodeTy`, the type of data stored on each node, and `EdgeTy`, the type of data stored on each edge. Use `void` when no data needs to be stored on nodes or edges. See galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph for other optional template parameters.

Below is an example of defining an LC_CSR_Graph with `int` as both its node data type and edge data type:

@snippet lonestar/tutorial_examples/GraphTraversalSerial.cpp Define LC_CSR_Graph

The following code snippet shows how to instantiate and read in a graph from a file (in binary .gr format):

@snippet lonestar/tutorial_examples/GraphTraversalSerial.cpp Read a graph

To access graph elements, use the following constructs:
<ul>
<li> **To iterate over nodes:** use the node iterator galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph::iterator given by galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph::begin and galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph::end.
<li> **To iterate over outgoing edges of a node:** use the edge iterator galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph::edge_iterator given by galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph::edge_begin and galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph::edge_end.
<li> **To access the data of a node:** use galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph::getData.
<li> **To access the data of an edge:** use galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph::getEdgeData.
<li> **To obtain the destination node of an outgoing edge:** use galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph::getEdgeDst.
</ul>

For details, see @ref galois_graphs.

The following code is a serial implementation of our running example. It is a *pull*-style example: iterate through all nodes, and for each node, add all outgoing edges' weights to the node data. (This example is written in C++11 to avoid mentioning node iterators and edge iterators explicitly.)

@subsection galois_ds_others Other Data Structures

Other data structures available in Galois include:

- galois::InsertBag, an unordered bag allowing thread-safe concurrent insertion (see @ref insert_bag);
- galois::Reducible, a template for reduction operations (see @ref reduction).


@section galois_parallel_loop Parallel Loop Iterators

We will focus on galois::do_all and galois::for_each in this section. For more information, see @ref parallel_loops.

@subsection galois_do_all galois::do_all

galois::do_all partitions the work items evenly among threads, and each thread performs work independently. It turns off conflict detection and assumes no new work items are created. Work stealing can be turned on to achieve load balance among threads. Example usages of galois::do_all are topology-driven algorithms iterating over nodes in a graph; and bags with independent work items, e.g. subset of nodes in a graph.

Specifically, galois::do_all expects the following inputs:
<ol>
<li> Range as galois::iterate, which takes one of the following parameters:
  <ul>
  <li> Pair of iterators for begin() and end()
  <li> Pair of unsigned integers for begin and end
  <li> Initializer list
  <li> Container inside which a well-defined iterator is implemented
  </ul>
<li> Operator, which can be specified as a lambda expression, function object (functor) or function pointer. Using a lambda expression is recommended.
<li> Options to turn on/off some features.
  <ul>
  <li> galois::steal to turn on work stealing
  <li> galois::chunk_size for the unit of work stealing. Chunk size is 32 by default.
  <li> galois::loopname to turn on the collection of statistics associated with the do_all loop, e.g. execution time in milliseconds, number of iterations executed.
  </ul>
</ol>

Below is the example of parallelizing our running example with a pull-style operator using galois::do_all. Note that the range for this do_all call is exactly the outer loop range in the serial implementation and that the operator is exactly the body of the outer loop in our serial implementation.

@subsubsection work_in_do_all Work Distribution in galois::do_all
How work is divided among threads in galois::do_all depends on whether work stealing is turned on. If work stealing is turned off, then the range is partitioned evenly among threads, and each thread works on its own partition independently. If work stealing is turned on, the work range is partitioned into chunks of N iterations where N is the chunk size. Each thread is then assigned an initial set of chunks and starts working from the beginning of the set. If a thread finishes its own chunks but other threads are still working on theirs, it will steal chunks from another thread's end of set of chunks.

@subsection galois_for_each galois::for_each

galois::for_each can be used for parallel iterations that may generate new work items and that may have conflicts among iterations. Operators must be cautious: All locks should be acquired successfully before the first write to user state (see galois::runtime::SimpleRuntimeContext::acquire). Optional features for galois::for_each include (1) turning off conflict detection, (2) asserting that no new work items will be created, and (3) specifying a desired schedule for processing active elements. galois::for_each is suitable to implement *push*-style algorithms.

galois::for_each uses galois::UserContext, a per-thread object, to track conflicts and new work. To insert new work items into the worklist, call galois::UserContext::push. To detect conflicts, galois::UserContext maintains a linked list of acquired items. Each sharable object, e.g. graph nodes, has a lock, which is automatically acquired when getData(), edge_begin(), edge_end(), edges(), etc. are called. A conflict is detected by the Galois runtime when the lock acquisition fails. Locks are released when aborting or finishing an iteration. Since Galois assumes cautious operators, i.e. no writes to user state before acquiring all locks, there is no need to rollback user state when aborting an iteration.

galois::for_each expects the following inputs:
<ol>
<li> Range as galois::iterate, which takes one of the following parameters:
  <ul>
  <li> Pair of iterators for begin() and end()
  <li> Pair of unsigned integers for begin and end
  <li> Initializer list
  <li> Container inside which a well-defined iterator is implemented
  </ul>
<li> Operator, which can be specified as a lambda expression, function object (functor) or function pointer. Using a lambda expression is recommended.
<li> Options to turn on/off some features.
  <ul>
  <li> galois::loopname to turn on the collection of statistics associated with the for_each loop, e.g. execution time in milliseconds; number of iterations executed, pushed, aborted and committed; etc.
  <li> galois::no_pushes when no new work items will be generated.
  <li> galois::disable_conflict_detection to turn off conflict detection.
  <li> galois::wl to specify the schedule to use.
  </ul>
</ol>

Below is the code snippet of using galois::for_each with conflict detection to implement our running example. It uses a push-style algorithm: Each node adds each of its edge's weight to the corresponding neighbor. Note that the operator code is written as in sequential code; and that the operator expects auto& ctx, a reference to galois::UserContext.

@snippet lonestar/tutorial_examples/GraphTraversalPushOperator.cpp For each with conflict detection

The code snippet below shows how to let an operator, instead of galois::for_each, take care of synchronization. Conflict detection is turned off in this case. Since there is no new work generated and the operator synchronizes node data, the same code can be implemented with galois::do_all as well, which is also shown in this example.

@section galois_worklists Worklists and Schedules

So far, we addressed only *topology-driven* algorithms, e.g. the same computation is done by all graph nodes. To implement *data-driven* algorithms, two more constructs are needed: (1) a worklist to track active elements, and (2) a scheduler to decide which active elements to work on first. New work items can be inserted to a worklist by calling galois::UserContext::push. This section focuses on the schedulers supported by Galois. For details, see @ref scheduler.

Galois supports a variety of scheduling policies; all of them are in the namespace galois::worklists. Example scheduling policies are galois::worklists::FIFO (approximate), galois::worklists::LIFO (approximate), galois::worklists::ChunkFIFO, galois::worklists::ChunkLIFO, galois::worklists::PerSocketChunkFIFO, galois::worklists::PerSocketChunkLIFO, galois::worklists::PerThreadChunkFIFO, galois::worklists::PerThreadChunkLIFO, and galois::worklists::OrderedByIntegerMetric. The default scheduler is galois::worklists::PerSocketChunkFIFO with a chunk size 32.

galois::worklists::OrderedByIntegerMetric can be used to implement a user-defined soft priority, a hint for the Galois runtime to schedule active elements where priority inversion will not result in incorrect answers or deadlocks. It needs an indexer function to map work items to an integer (priority). Each bin corresponds to a priority level and is itself a worklist, e.g. galois::worklists::PerSocketChunkLIFO with a chunk size 16. For details, see @ref obim_wl.

Let us use the single-source shortest path (SSSP) problem to illustrate the implementation of data-driven algorithms using Galois. Given (1) an edge-weighted graph G with no negative-weight cycles, and (2) a source node s; the SSSP problem asks for the shortest distance of every node n in G from s. Initially, s has distance 0 from itself, and all other nodes have a distance of infinity from s.

Here is the operator code common to all push-style SSSP algorithms:

@snippet lonestar/tutorial_examples/SSSPPushSimple.cpp SSSP push operator

And here is the code to declare worklists. Note how OBIM is declared with an indexer, e.g. reqIndexer, and another worklist, e.g. PerSocketChunkLIFO<16>.

@snippet lonestar/tutorial_examples/SSSPPushSimple.cpp Scheduler examples

Finally, here is the code for implementing data-driven algorithms. Initial active elements, e.g. the source node in this example, are passed to galois::iterate as an initializer list. Schedules are passed as options to galois::for_each. Note that OBIM expects an indexer instance for its construction.

@snippet lonestar/tutorial_examples/SSSPPushSimple.cpp Data-driven loops

@subsection galois_deterministic_iterator Deterministic Loop Iterator

galois::do_all and galois::for_each assume that the operator allows the loop iterations to be computed in any order, which may give legal yet different results non-deterministically. When it is important to have deterministic results, the deterministic loop iterator comes to the rescue: it executes the operator in rounds, and in each round, it deterministically chooses a conflict-free subset of currently active elements to process. In this way, the Galois deterministic loop iterator can produce the same answer even on different platforms, which we call "portable determinism".

Galois' deterministic loop iterator can be launched on-demand and parameter-less by passing `galois::wl<galois::worklists::Deterministic<>>` to galois::for_each. Use galois::UserContext::cautiousPoint to signal the cautious point in the operator if necessary.

@subsection galois_parameter_iterator ParaMeter Loop Iterator

An algorithm can benefit from parallelization only if it has a lot of parallelism. Galois provides the ParaMeter loop iterator to help algorithm designers find out the amount of parallelism in their algorithms. This parallelism, of course, depends on input-data. The ParaMeter loop iterator executes the operator in rounds and keeps track of statistics of parallelism for each round.

To launch Galois' ParaMeter loop iterator, pass `galois::wl<galois::worklists::ParaMeter<>>` to galois::for_each.

@htmlonly

Below is an example of using ParaMeter loop executor for SSSP:

@snippet lonestar/tutorial_examples/SSSPPushSimple.cpp ParaMeter loop iterator

Runs using the ParaMeter loop iterator will generate a parallelism profile as a csv file whose prefix is "ParaMeter-Stats-". A sample ParaMeter csv output looks like the following:

@htmlonly
<code>
LOOPNAME, STEP, PARALLELISM, WORKLIST_SIZE, NEIGHBORHOOD_SIZE<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 0, 1, 1, 4<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 1, 1, 3, 4<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 2, 2, 4, 4<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 3, 2, 2, 6<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 4, 1, 2, 4<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 5, 2, 3, 9<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 6, 2, 6, 6<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 7, 3, 6, 12<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 8, 5, 9, 18<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 9, 7, 12, 27<br>
sssp_ParaMeter, 10, 8, 18, 28<br>
...
</code>
@endhtmlonly

The parallelism profile should be interpreted as follows:
<ol>
<li> LOOPNAME indicates the for_each loop the statistics are for. In this example, it refers to the galois::for_each passed as an option galois::loopname("sssp_ParaMeter").
<li> STEP indicates which round the statistics are for. It counts from 0 whenever the corresponding for_each is launched.
<li> PARALLELISM indicates the number of active elements that can be processed in parallel in a given round.
<li> WORKLIST_SIZE indicates the number of available active elements in a given round.
<li> NEIGHBORHOOD_SIZE indicates the number of shared objects owned by committed iterations in a given round. NEIGHBORHOOD_SIZE / PARALLELISM gives the average size of the neighborhood of an active element.
</ol>

@section example_output Example Output of Galois Apps

Upon termination, Galois apps will output statistics in csv format, similar to the following:

@htmlonly
<code>
STAT_TYPE, REGION, CATEGORY, TOTAL_TYPE, TOTAL<br>
STAT, for_each_1, Iterations, TSUM, 9028387<br>
STAT, for_each_1, Time, TMAX, 1663<br>
STAT, for_each_1, Commits, TSUM, 9000000<br>
STAT, for_each_1, Pushes, TSUM, 0<br>
STAT, for_each_1, Conflicts, TSUM, 28387<br>
</code>
@endhtmlonly

The first row is the header of the csv output. REGION tells you which parallel loop the statistics are related to. For example, "for_each_1" refers to the galois::for_each which has an option of `galois::loopname("for_each_1")`.

CATEGORY specifies what is being reported for the parallel region. For galois::for_each loops, the following five statistics are reported:
<ol>
<li> `Iterations`: the number of iterations executed
<li> `Time`: the runtime, in milliseconds
<li> `Commits`: the number of iterations committed
<li> `Pushes`: the number of iterations generated
<li> `Conflicts`: the number of iterations aborted due to conflicts
</ol>

For galois::do_all loops, only time and iterations are reported, since there are no conflicts and pushes in galois::do_all loops.

TOTAL_TYPE tells you how the statistics are derived. TSUM means that the value is the sum of all threads' contributions; TMAX means it is the maximum among all threads for this statistic. TOTAL_TYPE is usually a reduction operation.


@section galois_morph_graph_api MorphGraph APIs

If your application requires modifying the graph topology, e.g. as in Delaunay mesh refinement, you need galois::graphs::MorphGraph. galois::graphs::MorphGraph supports all the functionalities in galois::graphs::LC_CSR_Graph except for size(), reporting the number of nodes in a graph; and sizeEdges(), reporting the number of edges in a graph. Additionally, galois::graphs::MorphGraph provides the following APIs to modify the graph topology:

<ol>
<li> galois::graphs::MorphGraph::createNode allocates space for node data, and galois::graphs::MorphGraph::addNode adds a node to a graph so the node can be found later by graph APIs.
<li> galois::graphs::MorphGraph::addEdge and galois::graphs::MorphGraph::addMultiEdge both add an edge between existing nodes to a graph. The former adds an edge only when the edge does not exist, while the latter always adds the edge.
<li> galois::graphs::MorphGraph::removeNode removes from a graph a node and all edges connecting to/from the node.
<li> galois::graphs::MorphGraph::removeEdge removes from a graph an edge and its incoming/symmetric counterpart, if there is any.
</ol>

Let us use galois::graphs::MorphGraph to construct and represent a two-dimensional torus. To define a galois::graphs::MorphGraph, you must provide as template parameters NodeTy, the type of node data; EdgeTy, the type of edge data; and a Boolean value indicating whether or not this is a directed graph. The following code snippet shows an example of defining a galois::graphs::MorphGraph. See galois::graphs::MorphGraph for details about other optional template parameters.

@snippet lonestar/tutorial_examples/TorusConstruction.cpp Define a MorphGraph

The following code snippet shows how to add nodes and edges to a galois::graphs::MorphGraph. Note that you need to create nodes first, then add the nodes to a galois::graphs::MorphGraph, and finally add edges in between the nodes.

@section mem_alloc Memory Allocators

Memory allocation plays an important role in making parallel programs scalable. Use the following Galois memory allocators with the recommended scenarios, especially in parallel loops.

<ol>
<li> Allocate objects with fixed size, e.g. set elements, from galois::FixedSizeAllocator.
<li> Allocate objects with variable size, e.g. vectors, from galois::Pow_2_VarSizeAlloc.
<li> Allocate objects used only in a loop iteration from galois::PerIterAllocTy. To use the per-iteration allocator, you need to pass galois::per_iter_alloc to galois::for_each. Here is an example of how to use it:
@code
using Graph = /* graph type definition */;
using GNode = Graph::GraphNode;
Graph g;
galois::for_each(
    galois::iterate(graph),
    [&] (GNode n, auto& ctx) {
      // syntax for conforming to STL allocator interface
      using Alloc = galois::PerIterAllocTy::rebind<GNode>::other;

      // fast, scalable allocation for v, a per-iteration vector
      // get per-iteration allocator from ctx to initialize v
      std::vector<GNode, Alloc> v(ctx.getPerIterAlloc());

      auto& d = graph.getData(n).data;
      std::copy(d.begin(), d.end(), std::back_inserter(v));
      // use of v below
    }
    , galois::per_iter_alloc()
    , galois::loopname("per_iter_alloc_example")
);
@endcode
</ol>
-->
@endhtmlonly

@section tuning_guides Tuning Guides

Performance tuning is required to make a parallel program fast and scalable. Readers should keep the following points in mind when tuning performance:
<ol>
<li> Chunk size can be tuned to trade-off work balance and overhead to access the worklist and may hurt priority enforcement when it is large.
<li> Schedules play an important role in performance. They trade-off the amount of wasted work and parallelism. However, there is overhead in managing additional information.
<li> NUMA-awareness in data structure and loop execution is critical for performance. For this reason, galois::iterate prefers local_iterator over iterator if provided a container. For more information, see @ref numa.
<li> Memory allocation in parallel loops can kill the scalability of a parallel program. Use `galois::preAlloc` to pre-allocate memory pages instead of on-demand page allocation in parallel loops.
</ol>

@section tutorial_conclusion Concluding Remarks

We have walked through the key user-level Galois constructs for writing a C++ parallel program. For details about the aforementioned constructs, library-level Galois constructs, and performance tuning, please refer to @ref Manual.
