 * @section Description
 *
 * There are two main classes, ::FileGraph and ::LC_XXX_Graph. The former
 * represents the pure structure of a graph (i.e., whether an edge exists between
 * two nodes) and cannot be modified. The latter allows values to be stored on
 * nodes and edges, but the structure of the graph cannot be modified.
