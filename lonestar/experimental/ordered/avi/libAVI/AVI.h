/**
 \brief AVI: abstract base class for AVI

 An AVI object consists of:

 1) A force field  \f$f_a(q_1,\ldots,q_N,t)\f$, where \f$q_a\f$ are degrees of
 freedom, and \f$f_a\f$ is the force acting on degree of freedom "a".\n 2) A
 mass matrix for the degrees of freedom of the potential. \n 3) A time step \n
 4) The last time at which the force field was updated\n
 5) The last time each degree of freedom was updated\n

 The AVI class assumes that there exists four provided global
 arrays, accessed through a LocalToGlobalMap:

 1) An array Qval with the value of each degree of freedom at its last update,
 \f$q_a^{i-1}\f$\n 2) An array Vval with the latest value of the time derivative
 of the degrees of freedom at its last update, \f$v_a^{i-1}\f$.\n 3) An array
 Vbval with the latest value of the time derivative of the degree of freedom at
 the middle of a time step, \f$v_a^{i-1/2}\f$.\n 4) An array Tval with the last
 time at which a degree of freedom was updated, \f$t_a^{i-1}\f$.

 Given \f$q_a^{i-1}\f$, \f$v_a^{i-1/2}\f$ and \f$t_a^{i-1}\f$, the class
 computes \f$q_a^i\f$, \f$v_a^i\f$ and \f$v_a^{i+1/2}\f$ for each
 degree of freedom of the object's force field. It also updates the
 values of \f$t_a^i\f$ and the objects latest time.

 The update is as follows:

 If \f$q_a\f$ does not have imposed values \f$q_a(t)\f$ (e.g., Dirichlet bounday
 conditions), then

 1) Compute \f$q_a^i = q_a^{i-1} + (t-t_a^i) v_a^{i-1/2}\f$ for each \f$a\f$,
 where \f$t\f$ is the current time of the object.\n 2) Solve \f$ M_{ab} \Delta
 v_b = - \Delta t f_a(q_a^i)\f$ for \f$\Delta v_b\f$, where \f$f_a(t)\f$ is the
 force on node \f$a\f$ by the force field in the object computed with
 \f$q_a^i\f$.\n 3) Compute \f$ v_a^i = v_a^{i-1/2} + \Delta v_b/2\f$\n 4)
 Compute \f$ v_a^{i+1/2} = v_a^{i-1/2} + \Delta v_b\f$

 Else, set \f$q_a^i=q_a(t_a^i)\f$, \f$v_a^i=\dot{q}_a(t_a^i)\f$ and
 \f$v_a^{i+1/2}\f$ is defined to any value, it is not guaranteed to
 have any meaning.

 The class also has an initialization procedure to compute the
 initial values of \f$v_a^{1/2}\f$.

 Following the convention elsewhere in the code, degrees of freedom
 are labeled with field number f and degree of freedom number for
 that field, b. Even thought it is not the most natural numbering in
 the context of ODEs, it simplifies the communication with the rest
 of the code. Field and degree of freedom numbers begin from zero.

 The class separates the update process into three different functions: gather,
 update, assemble. In this way more flexibility is provided to be able to work
 with force fields that depend, perhaps, on sets of internal variables that are
 not necessarily updated with AVI.

 Imposed values need to be provided separately. A virtual procedure is
 constructed to this end.

 \todo The update routine does not take further arguments that may not need to
 be updated but may be needed to compute the force field, such as when dealing
 with plasticity or a coupled heat conduction problem. We will need to deal with
 this eventually.
