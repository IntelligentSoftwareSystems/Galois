/**
   \brief Computes a residue  on an element

   A Residue object computes the values of a vector function of some or all the
   fields in the element, with the distinguishing feature that there is one
   component of the function per degree of freedom of the participating fields.

   A Residue object contains two concepts:\n
   1) A procedure to compute the value of the function\n
   2) A pointer to the element over which to compute it\n

   Each residue acts then as a container of a pointer to an element object,
   and an operation to perform on that object. In this way the same element can
   be used for several operation in a single computation (The alternative of
   adding more layers of inheritance to the element classes makes the last
   possibility very clumsy).

   Additionally, operation that need higher-levels of specialization, such as
   special classes of elements, can perform type-checking in their own
   implementation.

   The class residue is in fact very similar to a general container,
   in the sense that the object it points to does not need to be an
   element but can be any object that permits the computation of the
   function and can use the (field, dof) notation to label the inputs and
   outputs.

   The precise fields to be utilized in the computation of the
   operation may vary from element type to element type, hence these
   will generally be specified.

   More precisely, a residual is a function
   \f[
   F^f_a(u^0_0,u^0_1, \ldots, u^0_{n_0-1}, u^0_1, \ldots, u^{K}_{n_{K-1}-1}),
   \f]
   where \f$u^f_a\f$  is the a-th degree of freedom of the f-th participating
   field in the function. A total of K of the element fields participate as
   arguments in the function. The f-th participating field has a total of
   \f$n_f\f$ degrees of freedom. The coefficient of the force "f" runs from 0 to
   K-1, and "a" ia the degree of freedom index that ranges from 0 to \f$n_f\f$.

   We need to specify  specify which field in the element will represent the
   f-th participating field in the function F. For instance, the field number 2
   in the element can be used as the first argument of F, i.e., as participating
   field number 0.

   \todo This class does not accept the input of additional parameters that may
   be needed for the evaluation of T that may not be solved for.

   \todo The assembly  procedure should probably be changed
