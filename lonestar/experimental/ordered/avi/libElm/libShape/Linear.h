/**
 \brief set of linear shape functions in SPD dimensions

 The linear shape functions in SPD dimensions are precisely the barycentric
 coordinates of a point in the simplex defined by SPD+1 points.

 Since quadrature points are often expressed in baricentric coordinates, this
 class was implemented to take the SPD+1 barycentric coordinates of a point as
 arguments only.

 Since barycentric coordinates are linearly dependent, the class chooses SPD
 coordinates as arguments of the shape functions. This choice is made by
 shuffling the coordinates so that the first SPD coordinates are the linearly
 independent ones.

 The possibility of shuffling becomes useful, for example, in tetrahedra.
 Without shuffling the class would have \f[ N_a(\lambda_0,\lambda_1,\lambda_2),
 \qquad a=0,1,2,3 \f] and the derivatives of the shape function with respect to
 the same arguments. With a shuffling  of the form
 \f$(\lambda_0,\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3)\f$ to
 \f$(\lambda_0,\lambda_1,\lambda_3,\lambda_2)\f$ it is possible to have \f[
 N_a(\lambda_0,\lambda_1,\lambda_3), \qquad a=0,1,2,3.
 \f]
 The derivatives returned here, are clearly different that in the previous case.
 The reason that this is useful is that these derivatives are precisely the
 derivatives with respect to the Cartesian coordinates of the shape functions in
 a standard parametric tet ( with vertices at (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,0), (0,0,1)
 )
