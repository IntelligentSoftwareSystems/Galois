/**
   \brief
   base class for any quadrature rule

   A quadrature rule provides and approximation of the integral over a domain
   \f$\Omega\f$, and it has:\n
          1) A number of quadrature point coordinates in \f$\Omega\f$. (map)
      2) Weights at each quadrature point
      3) A second set of coordinates for the same quadrature points. (Shape)

   The number of coordinates in (1) of each quadrature point should be
   unisolvent, i.e., each coordinate can be varied independently. The reason for
   this choice is that otherwise we need a way to convey the constraint between
   coordinates when functions of these coordinates and their derivatives are
   considered. For example, the mapping from the parametric configuration to the
   real space in finite elements.

   In addition to the unisolvent set of coordinates above, the class also allows
   for an alternative set of coordinates for each gauss point. These do not need
   to be unisolvent, and can be used to localize the quadrature points when
   embedded in a higher dimensional space. For example, if \f$\Omega\f$ is a
   triangle in 3D, then the second set of coordinates provide the coordinates of
   these points in 3D.

   A specific example is the following: consider a triangle in 2D, and
   the integration over a segment on its boundary. The quadrature
   object for a segment should have only one (map) coordinate in (1)
   to be unisolvent. This coordinate is one of the barycentric
   coordinates of the quadrature point over the segment. However, if
   we have a function over the triangle and would like to restrict its
   values to the segment, we need the coordinates of the quadrature
   points in the triangle. This is the case when integrating a shape
   function in the triangle over the segment. This second set of
   coordinates is given in (3).

   Based on this example we shall call the coordinates in (1)  map coordinates,
   and the coordinates in (3)  Shape coordinates.

   Although the coordinates in (3) are not  a natural inclusion in a quadrature
   rule, they provide the simplest implementation for the scenario just
   described.

   A number of specific Quadrature objects are defined in
   Quadrature.cpp, and declared here.
