/// Represents a discrete random variable.
/** A Var stores the \a label of the variable (an unsigned integer-valued
 *  unique ID) and the number of possible values (\a states) of that variable.
 *  Two Var objects with the same label are assumed to be identical (i.e., it
 *  is assumed that they have the same number of possible states).
 *
 *  In the documentation, we use the following notational conventions. The
 * discrete random variable with label \f$l\f$ is denoted as \f$x_l\f$, and the
 * number of possible values of this variable as \f$S_l\f$; this is represented
 * in code by the object Var(\f$l\f$,\f$S_l\f$). The set of possible values of
 *  variable \f$x_l\f$ is denoted \f$X_l := \{0,1,\dots,S_l-1\}\f$.
