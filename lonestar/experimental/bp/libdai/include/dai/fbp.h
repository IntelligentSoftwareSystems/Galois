/// Approximate inference algorithm "Fractional Belief Propagation" [\ref WiH03]
/** The Fractional Belief Propagation algorithm is like Belief
 *  Propagation, but associates each factor with a weight (scale parameter)
 *  which controls the divergence measure being minimized. Standard
 *  Belief Propagation corresponds to the case of FBP where each weight
 *  is 1. When cast as an EP algorithm, BP (and EP) minimize
 *  the inclusive KL-divergence, i.e. \f$\min_q KL(p||q)\f$ (note that the
 *  Bethe free energy is typically derived from \f$ KL(q||p) \f$). If each
 *  factor \a I has weight \f$ c_I \f$, then FBP minimizes the
 *  alpha-divergence with \f$ \alpha=1/c_I \f$ for that factor, which also
 *  corresponds to Power EP [\ref Min05].
 *
 *  The messages \f$m_{I\to i}(x_i)\f$ are passed from factors \f$I\f$ to
 * variables \f$i\f$. The update equation is given by: \f[ m_{I\to i}(x_i)
 * \propto \left( \sum_{x_{N_I\setminus\{i\}}} f_I(x_I)^{1/c_I} \prod_{j\in
 * N_I\setminus\{i\}} m_{I\to j}^{1-1/c_I} \prod_{J\in N_j\setminus\{I\}}
 * m_{J\to j} \right)^{c_I} \f] After convergence, the variable beliefs are
 * calculated by: \f[ b_i(x_i) \propto \prod_{I\in N_i} m_{I\to i} \f] and the
 * factor beliefs are calculated by: \f[ b_I(x_I) \propto f_I(x_I)^{1/c_I}
 * \prod_{j \in N_I} m_{I\to j}^{1-1/c_I} \prod_{J\in N_j\setminus\{I\}} m_{J\to
 * j} \f] The logarithm of the partition sum is approximated by: \f[ \log Z =
 * \sum_{I} \sum_{x_I} b_I(x_I) \big( \log f_I(x_I) - c_I \log b_I(x_I) \big) +
 * \sum_{i} (c_i - 1) \sum_{x_i} b_i(x_i) \log b_i(x_i) \f] where the variable
 * weights are defined as \f[ c_i := \sum_{I \in N_i} c_I \f]
 *
 *  \todo Add nice way to set weights
