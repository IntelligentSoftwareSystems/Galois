/// Represents a factor graph.
/** Both Bayesian Networks and Markov random fields can be represented in a
 *  unifying representation, called <em>factor graph</em> [\ref KFL01],
 *  implemented in libDAI by the FactorGraph class.
 *
 *  Consider a probability distribution over \f$N\f$ discrete random variables
 *  \f$x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{N-1}\f$ that factorizes as a product of \f$M\f$ factors,
 * each of which depends on some subset of the variables: \f[
 *    P(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{N-1}) = \frac{1}{Z} \prod_{I=0}^{M-1} f_I(x_I), \qquad
 *    Z = \sum_{x_0}\dots\sum_{x_{N-1}} \prod_{I=0}^{M-1} f_I(X_I).
 *  \f]
 *  Each factor \f$f_I\f$ is a function from an associated subset
 *  of variables \f$X_I \subset \{x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{N-1}\}\f$ to the nonnegative
 *  real numbers.
 *
 *  For a Bayesian network, each factor corresponds to a (conditional)
 *  probability table, whereas for a Markov random field, each factor
 *  corresponds to a maximal clique of the undirected graph.
 *
 *  Factor graphs explicitly express the factorization structure of the
 *  corresponding probability distribution. A factor graph is a bipartite graph,
 *  containing variable nodes and factor nodes, and an edge between a variable
 *  node and a factor node if the corresponding factor depends on that variable.
 *  In libDAI, this structure is represented by a BipartiteGraph.
 *
 *  So basically, a FactorGraph consists of a BipartiteGraph, a vector of Var 's
 *  and a vector of TFactor 's.
 *
 *  \idea Alternative implementation of undo factor changes: the only things
 * that have to be undone currently are setting a factor to 1 and setting a
 * factor to a Kronecker delta. This could also be implemented in the TFactor
 * itself, which could maintain its state (ones/delta/full) and act accordingly.
 * Update: it seems that the proposed functionality would not be enough for CBP,
 * for which it would make more sense to add more levels of backup/restore.
 *
 *  \todo Write a method that applies evidence (should we represent evidence as
 * a map<Var,size_t> or as a map<size_t,size_t>?)
