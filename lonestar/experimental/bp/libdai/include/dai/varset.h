/// Calculates the linear index in the Cartesian product of the variables in \a

/// specified by \a state.
/** \param vs Set of variables for which the linear state should be calculated;
 *  \param state Specifies the states of some variables.
 *  \return The linear index in the Cartesian product of the variables in \a vs
 *  corresponding with the joint assignment specified by \a state, where
 * variables for which no state is specified are assumed to be in state 0.
 *
 *  The linear index is calculated as follows. The variables in \a vs are
 *  ordered according to their label (in ascending order); say \a vs corresponds
 * with the set \f$\{x_{l(0)},x_{l(1)},\dots,x_{l(n-1)}\}\f$ with \f$l(0) < l(1)
 * < \dots < l(n-1)\f$, where variable \f$x_l\f$ has label \a l. Denote by
 * \f$S_l\f$ the number of possible values
 *  ("states") of variable \f$x_l\f$. The argument \a state corresponds
 *  with a mapping \a s that assigns to each variable \f$x_l\f$ a state
 * \f$s(x_l) \in \{0,1,\dots,S_l-1\}\f$, where \f$s(x_l)=0\f$ if \f$x_l\f$ is
 * not specified in \a state. The linear index \f$S\f$ corresponding with \a
 * state is now calculated by: \f{eqnarray*}
 *    S &:=& \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} s(x_{l(i)}) \prod_{j=0}^{i-1} S_{l(j)} \\
 *      &= & s(x_{l(0)}) + s(x_{l(1)}) S_{l(0)} + s(x_{l(2)}) S_{l(0)} S_{l(1)}
 * + \dots + s(x_{l(n-1)}) S_{l(0)} \cdots S_{l(n-2)}. \f}
 *
 *  \note If \a vs corresponds with \f$\{x_l\}_{l\in L}\f$, and \a state
 * specifies a state for each variable \f$x_l\f$ for \f$l\in L\f$,
 * calcLinearState() induces a mapping \f$\sigma : \prod_{l\in L} X_l \to
 * \{0,1,\dots,\prod_{l\in L} S_l-1\}\f$ that maps a joint state to a linear
 * index; this is the inverse of the mapping \f$\sigma^{-1}\f$ induced by
 * calcState().
 *
 *  \see calcState()

/** \param vs Set of variables to which \a linearState refers
 *  \param linearState should be smaller than vs.nrStates().
 *  \return A mapping \f$s\f$ that maps each Var \f$x_l\f$ in \a vs to its state
 * \f$s(x_l)\f$, as specified by \a linearState.
 *
 *  The variables in \a vs are ordered according to their label (in ascending
 * order); say \a vs corresponds with the set
 * \f$\{x_{l(0)},x_{l(1)},\dots,x_{l(n-1)}\}\f$ with \f$l(0) < l(1) < \dots <
 * l(n-1)\f$, where variable \f$x_l\f$ has label \a l. Denote by \f$S_l\f$ the
 * number of possible values
 *  ("states") of variable \f$x_l\f$ with label \a l.
 *  The mapping \f$s\f$ returned by this function is defined as:
 *  \f{eqnarray*}
 *    s(x_{l(i)}) = \left\lfloor\frac{S \mbox { mod } \prod_{j=0}^{i}
 * S_{l(j)}}{\prod_{j=0}^{i-1} S_{l(j)}}\right\rfloor \qquad \mbox{for all
 * $i=0,\dots,n-1$}. \f} where \f$S\f$ denotes the value of \a linearState.
 *
 *  \note If \a vs corresponds with \f$\{x_l\}_{l\in L}\f$, calcState() induces
 * a mapping \f$\sigma^{-1} : \{0,1,\dots,\prod_{l\in L} S_l-1\} \to \prod_{l\in
 * L} X_l\f$ that maps a linear index to a joint state; this is the inverse of
