/// Represents the neighborhood structure of nodes in an undirected, bipartite
/// graph.
/** A bipartite graph has two types of nodes: type 1 and type 2. Edges can occur
 * only between nodes of different type. Nodes are indexed by an unsigned
 * integer. If there are nrNodes1() nodes of type 1 and nrNodes2() nodes of type
 * 2, the nodes of type 1 are numbered 0,1,2,...,nrNodes1()-1 and the nodes of
 * type 2 are numbered 0,1,2,...,nrNodes2()-1. An edge between node \a n1 of
 * type 1 and node \a n2 of type 2 is represented by a Edge(\a n1,\a n2).
 *
 *  A BipartiteGraph is implemented as a sparse adjacency list, i.e., it stores
 * for each node a list of its neighboring nodes. More precisely: it stores for
 * each node of type 1 a vector of Neighbor structures (accessible by the nb1()
 * method) describing the neighboring nodes of type 2; similarly, for each node
 *  of type 2 it stores a vector of Neighbor structures (accessibly by the nb2()
 * method) describing the neighboring nodes of type 1. Thus, each node has an
 * associated variable of type BipartiteGraph::Neighbors, which is a vector of
 *  Neighbor structures, describing its neighboring nodes of the other type.
 *  \idea Cache second-order neighborhoods in BipartiteGraph.
