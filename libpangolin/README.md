Overview of Graph Pattern Mining (GPM) in Galois
================================================================================

This is the Pangolin framework [1] for efficient and flexible graph mining. 
It uses the bliss library [2][3] for graph isomorphism check. 
The license for this library is in the bliss directory: 
note that **it does not use the same license as the rest of Galois**.
To run Pangolin applications, please go to ../lonestarmine/README.md
for more details.

INPUT
===========

We support four input graph format: **gr**, **txt**, **adj**, **mtx**.
For unlabeled graphs, we use the gr graph format, same as other Galois benchmarks.
**Make sure that the graph is symmetric and contains no self-loop or redundant edges**.
If not, use the convert tool in tools/graph-convert/ to convert the graph.
We use **adj** format for labeled graphs as also used by Arabesque and RStream.
The **adj** format takes as input graphs with the following formats (vertex labeled):

```
# <num vertices> <num edges>
<vertex id> <vertex label> [<neighbour id1> <neighbour id2> ... <neighbour id n>]
<vertex id> <vertex label> [<neighbour id1> <neighbour id2> ... <neighbour id n>]
...
```

We currently do not support graphs label on edges.
Vertex ids are expected to be sequential integers between 0 and (total number of vertices - 1).
For testing, we have prepared a test graph **citeseer** in $GALOIS_HOME/lonestarmine/test_data.

BUILD
===========

1. Run cmake at BUILD directory: 

`cd build; cmake -DUSE_PANGOLIN=1 ../`

To enable GPU mining, use: 

`cmake -DUSE_PANGOLIN=1 -DUSE_GPU=1 ../`

2. Run make:

`cd <BUILD>/lonestar/experimental/fsm; make -j`

RUN
===========

The following are a few example command lines.

- `$ ./tc_mine gr $GALOIS_HOME/lonestarmine/test_data/citeseer.csgr -t 28`
- `$ ./kcl gr $GALOIS_HOME/lonestarmine/test_data/citeseer.csgr -k=3 -t 28`
- `$ ./motif gr $GALOIS_HOME/lonestarmine/test_data/citeseer.csgr -k=3 -t 56`
- `$ ./fsm adj $GALOIS_HOME/lonestarmine/test_data/citeseer.sadj -k=2 -ms=300 -t 28`

PERFORMANCE
===========

Please see details in the paper.
